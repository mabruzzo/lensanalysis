High Priority
=============

Debugging
  - Figure out why "peak_count" get's turned on for saving when it's not
    specified at the command line
  - Figure out why the storage directories are not made within the cosmology
    collection subdirectory

New Features
  - Add MPI support



Low-Mid Priority
================

General
  - Add a test suite

Refactoring
  - Centralize all parsing of object names & descriptors. Currently it's done
    in at least 2 separate spots using 2 sets of functions
  - Refactor DescriptorEnum so that it draws from the equivalent of python
    3.6.4's enum.Flag class (https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html). This
    would greatly streamline the process of checking equivalence of 2
    combinations of flags. It may be possible to draw from the source code they
    include on the webpage and subclass Enum from the enum34 library.
  - Come up with a way to keep track of the analysis object names in accordance
    with the open/closed principle
  - refactor the building of the procedure to be in accordance with the open
    closed principle
  - Update the FnameFormatter class to take advantage of keyword arguments from
    newstyle string formatting (need to make sure its possible to specify a
    keyword argument that corresponds to an int and specify a minimum amount of
    zero padding
  - Allow for exclusive specification of Fiducial/Sampled Cosmology collections
    (currently it requires both)

New Features
  - Ability to post-process single-z Convergence Map or a Shear Catalog from a
    single shear catalog
  - Ability to keep track of collections of analysis products with different
    value characteristics in a given analysis collection (mainly different
    smoothing scales & possibly different tomography bins, peak counting bins,
    noise addition schemes)
  - "Emulator-like Class" that interpolates the chi-squared values
