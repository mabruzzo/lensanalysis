High Priority
=============

New Features
  - Add a new subclass of IntermediateStep - RebinShearCat and update the
    procedure construction so that can be made use of.

Low-Mid Priority
================

Refactoring
  - Come up with a way to keep track of the analysis object names in accordance
    with the open/closed principle
  - refactor the building of the procedure to be in accordance with the open
    closed principle
  - Update the FnameFormatter class to take advantage of keyword arguments from
    newstyle string formatting. The basic idea behind how to do this under a
    class declaration in fname_formatter.py
  - Come up with a new subclass of IntermediateStep that standardizes a pattern
    of lazy initialization depending on the properties of the data object that
    get passed into the procedure step. Two separate Procedure Steps already
    exist that do this with independent implementations in rebinning and adding
    noise.
  - Refactor the ProcedureConfig object so that we have different objects
    responsible for keeping track of configuration details for different parts
    of the procedure. By doing this, we will reduce the size of
    ProcedureConfig. Examples of areas to do this for include: Rebinning and
    Peak Count Bins. By doing this for measurable features, it should be a step
    in the right direction for bringing the configurations into accordance with
    the open/closed principle
  - Subclass ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser or another configParser subclass to
    return absolute paths relative to the ConfigParser's save location instead
    of using get_abs_paths.

New Features
  - Ability to post-process single-z Convergence Map or a Shear Catalog from a
    single shear catalog using a single script (this will involve writing a new
    procedure for the former)
  - Ability to keep track of collections of analysis products with different
    value characteristics in a given analysis collection (mainly different
    smoothing scales & possibly different tomography bins, peak counting bins)
  - "Emulator-like Class" that interpolates the chi-squared values
  - add option to compute features without adding noise (or objects that
    already have noise).
  - add option to save smoothed shear maps. Then refactor the smoothing of
    shear maps to not occur immediately before the Kaiser-Squires transform.
