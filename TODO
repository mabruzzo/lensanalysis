High Priority
=============

New Features
  - Add a new subclass of IntermediateStep - RebinShearCat and update the
    procedure construction so that can be made use of.
  - Allow for the Creation of unique histogram bins for tomographic peak
    (in other words, allow different tomographic bins to have different
    histogram bins).
    

Low-Mid Priority
================

Refactoring
  - Refactor steps involving smoothing and Converting Shear maps. As of now we
    can do both at once or do each separately. This is probably fine (we
    definitely want to be able to do the smoothing separately), but we
    should probably create specific interfaces for each process and then
    combined procedure implement both interfaces.
  - Come up with a way to keep track of the analysis object names in accordance
    with the open/closed principle
  - refactor the building of the procedure to be in accordance with the open
    closed principle
  - Update the FnameFormatter class to take advantage of keyword arguments from
    newstyle string formatting. The basic idea behind how to do this under a
    class declaration in fname_formatter.py
  - Allow for exclusive specification of Fiducial/Sampled Cosmology collections
    (currently it requires both)
  - allow for the initialization from an arbitrary analysis object that is
    used in our analysis (currently post_process_cat.py can only start from
    shear_cat)

New Features
  - Ability to post-process single-z Convergence Map or a Shear Catalog from a
    single shear catalog using a single script (this will involve writing a new
    procedure for the former)
  - Ability to keep track of collections of analysis products with different
    value characteristics in a given analysis collection (mainly different
    smoothing scales & possibly different tomography bins, peak counting bins)
  - "Emulator-like Class" that interpolates the chi-squared values
  - add option to compute features without adding noise (or objects that
    already have noise).
