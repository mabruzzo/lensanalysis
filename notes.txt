The processing script was initially inspired by the realization that very 
similar operations can be used post processing weak lensing products with 
minor variations (i.e. if we are measuring peak counts or tomographic peak 
counts). 

The whole procedural step was conceived with the best of intentions, but I 
think I got a little carried away. I think things are probably a little too 
atomic.

However, the whole collection storage potions turned out as well as I could 
have hoped.

In reality, it would probably be better to make the main procedure much less 
flexible, but leave hooks after the creation of every analysis product 
(such as Shear Map, Convergence Map, Noisy Convergence Map, Smoothed 
Convergence Map, etc.) that allow for procedure steps to save the product and 
calculate features.
